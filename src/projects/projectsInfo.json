        "I contributed to the Beehyve project, by creating an AR experience for the beehive. The hive has sensors on it, which send the live data to the cloud. The data is then fetched and displayed in the experience. The goal of the project was to show the data in a more interactive way, to make it easier to understand for the user.",
